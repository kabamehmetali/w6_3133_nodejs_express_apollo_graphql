This project is a full-stack application built with **Node.js, Express, GraphQL, and MongoDB** on the backend and **React, Apollo Client, and Bootstrap** on the frontend. It implements user authentication (signup and login) and CRUD operations for managing employee records using GraphQL.

> **Note:** This README covers the project setup and usage before further role-based filtering modifications (such as showing only a normal user's employees versus admin viewing all). It explains everything up to the point where the modal/backend updates for default user registration and employee filtering are introduced.

## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the `serverside` folder:**
   ```bash
   cd serverside
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure Environment Variables:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the `serverside` folder with the following content (adjust as needed):
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/comp3133__101453763_assigment1
   JWT_SECRET=yourSecretKeyHere
   PORT=4000
   ```
4. **Start the Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   MongoDB connected successfully
   Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the `frontend` folder:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the React Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app should open in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
